# Lesson Plan Template
Last reviewed **08 June 2018** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
In this session we'll look at an alternative to database content management, flat file or static site generation. Although not new, this method has gained a good deal of traction in recent years. We'll look at the pros and cons of building sites in this way and have a go at some of the most common frameworks.
### Why is this important
Recently flat file generators have been picking up a lot of traction and in some use cases replacing content managed solutions. GitHub pages for example is almost the de-facto solution for project documentation for GitHub based projects. Personal sites and slides also fit really well into this format.
