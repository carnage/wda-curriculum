# Security
Last reviewed **29 September 2019** by **Chris Riley (Trainer)**

## Description
Building sites and applications that are secure is paramount. In this session we'll be looking at how to recognise vulnerabilities in existing developments, how these could be exploited and, of course, how to fix and guard against attacks.

### Why this is important
It is our duty to build with security in mind. If what we build is not safe and secure, critical business relationships can be compromised. Insecurity allows for the spread and escalation of malware, attacks on other websites, and even attacks against national targets and infrastructure.
