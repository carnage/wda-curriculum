# Source Control
Last reviewed **06 April 2018** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
In this session we'll learn about change management and version control. How it is possible for multiple developers work on the same code at the same time using git as a version control tool. We'll also look at how we can use git to provide a workflow and code review process to make sure we are solving the problems at hand while producing the best code possible.

## Outcomes

- Install git on your machine
