# WDAN Apprentice Curriculum
Web development apprenticeship curriculum and learning materials

## Structure
The repo is set out as a reference tool, grouping documents by their type. Once we have a comprehensive library in place we can add layers to group lessons, tasks and tutorials in different ways or as standalone courses.

1. **Lessons** - Lesson plans for group training delivered by an experienced web development professional
2. **Tutorials** - 'How to' documents as reference for apprentices to achieve common tasks without supervision
3. **Tasks** - Challenges in the form of problems to be solved with code or development techniques (these may move to separate repos)

## Workflow
We are constantly reviewing, adding and updating this content. Every trainer will be assigned an issue to review the content of their forthcoming session 2 weeks before delivery. This ensures all our content is as current and relevant as possible.

1. Claim (or be assigned) issue
2. Create branch of full issue name including number (e.g. Review-code-standards-lesson-#30)
3. Complete edits/amends
4. Update last reviewed info
5. Push branch
6. Create PR and tag or ping one of the team for a review and merge
